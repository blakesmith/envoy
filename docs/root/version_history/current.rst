1.20.0 (Pending)
================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* grpc: gRPC async client can be cached and shared accross filter instances in the same thread, this feature is turned off by default, can be turned on by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_grpc_async_client_cache`` to true.
* http: set the default :ref:`lazy headermap threshold <arch_overview_http_header_map_settings>` to 3,
  which defines the minimal number of headers in a request/response/trailers required for using a
  dictionary in addition to the list. Setting the `envoy.http.headermap.lazy_map_min_size` runtime
  feature to a non-negative number will override the default value.
* listener: added the :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>`
  field and changed the default for reuse_port from false to true, as the feature is now well
  supported on the majority of production Linux kernels in use. The default change is aware of hot
  restart, as otherwise the change would not be backwards compatible between restarts. This means
  that hot restarting on to a new binary will retain the default of false until the binary undergoes
  a full restart. To retain the previous behavior, either explicitly set the new configuration
  field to false, or set the runtime feature flag `envoy.reloadable_features.listener_reuse_port_default_enabled`
  to false. As part of this change, the use of reuse_port for TCP listeners on both macOS and
  Windows has been disabled due to suboptimal behavior. See the field documentation for more
  information.

Bug Fixes
---------
*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

Removed Config or Runtime
-------------------------
*Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

* http: removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_upstream_wait_connect_response`` runtime guard and legacy code paths.
* http: removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_preconnect`` runtime guard and legacy code paths.
* listener: removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.disable_tls_inspector_injection`` runtime guard and legacy code paths.

New Features
------------
* http: added :ref:`string_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.string_match>` in the header matcher.
* http: added support for :ref:`max_requests_per_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.max_requests_per_connection>` for both upstream and downstream connections.

Deprecated
----------
* cluster: :ref:`max_requests_per_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.max_requests_per_connection>` is deprecated in favor of :ref:`max_requests_per_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.max_requests_per_connection>`.
* http: the HeaderMatcher fields :ref:`exact_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.exact_match>`, :ref:`safe_regex_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.safe_regex_match>`,
  :ref:`prefix_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.prefix_match>`, :ref:`suffix_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.suffix_match>` and
  :ref:`contains_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.contains_match>` are deprecated by :ref:`string_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.string_match>`.
* listener: :ref:`reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.reuse_port>` has been
  deprecated in favor of :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>`.
  At the same time, the default has been changed from false to true. See above for more information.
